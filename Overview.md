**Overview.md — Python Calculator and Git operations**
📘 Project Overview
  This project is a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand core Python concepts and learn how to use Git and GitHub effectively through VS Code.

**🎯 Project Purpose**
1.  To learn how to structure a small command-line project
2.  To use Git for version control
3.  To push a project to GitHub using the VS Code terminal

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
1.  Python (Core Programming)

2.  Git (Version Control)

3.  GitHub (Remote Repository Hosting)

4.  VS Code (Development Environment)
